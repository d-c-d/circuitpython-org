In the F401 series, the chip is the cheapest, even cheaper than some F1, and crushed F1 on the main frequency, and has a floating-point arithmetic module, the IO port contains all the basic functions. Therefore, it is possible to provide a learning platform with a very high cost performance for beginners. In practical applications, it is not because the computing power is insufficient, and the IO port is incomplete and hinders development.

## Product details
1. STM32F411CEU6 100Mhz, 128KB RAM, 512KB ROM
2. 25MHZ high speed crystal oscillator & 32.768khz 6PF low speed crystal oscillator
3. Gold sinking process is adopted, lead-free process is used, and the needle arrangement is gold-plated, which is more environmentally friendly
3. Flash pads are reserved to provide USBDisk&&FATFFS routines
4. Support for MicroPython programming with available MicroPython firmware
5. Support for Arduino programming development
